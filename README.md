## Dataset Description

This dataset captures incidents of crime within the City of Los Angeles, spanning from the year 2020 onwards. It was found from the Data.gov database catalog. (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present) It contains 853,000 rows, each representing a crime incident. There are 28 columns that describe various information about each crime. “DR_NO” (string) is the official file code from the LAPD which is unique to each case. There is also a series of columns for additional crime codes to attach any additional, less serious crimes within a single case. “Date Occurred” (date) and “Time Occurred” (time) provide information about the time of the crime. “Area Name” (string) contains the 21 neighborhoods within Los Angeles; additionally, there is more specific geographic data containing the category of premise (string) and a street address represented by “Location.” There is also latitude (int) and longitude (int). The dataset also contains information about the victim of each crime, including their age (int), sex (string), and descent (string). Finally, there is information about weapons used–if applicable–which is represented by a weapon code (string) and description (string). 

## Question 1
